# VulkanTriangle

This is a derivative of Sascha Willems Vulkan repository. I recommend checking out his work.

There are wrappers for most Vulkan objects used in this example, to allow for command chaining. Basic Vulkan initialization code is contained with the VulkanBaseContext files. Specific code to create a triangle is inside the VulkanTriangle files.
